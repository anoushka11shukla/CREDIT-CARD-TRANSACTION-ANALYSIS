## Key Questions (KPIs)
â€¢ What is the total revenue and number of transactions by quarter?  
â€¢ Which card category generates the most revenue and interest?  
â€¢ Which acquisition channel is most effective in revenue contribution?  
â€¢ Which income group or job type generates the highest revenue?  
â€¢ What is the distribution of revenue by customer education, age, and marital status?  
â€¢ Which states contribute the most to credit card revenue?  
â€¢ What is the impact of transaction method (swipe, chip, online) on revenue?

## Process
1. Imported and cleaned data from multiple sources: transaction, customer, and card metadata.  
2. Handled missing values, standardized data formats, and ensured relationship integrity.  
3. Created calculated columns and DAX measures for custom KPIs.  
4. Designed Power BI visualizations: bar charts, slicers, cards, and line graphs for temporal and categorical analysis.  
5. Published an interactive dashboard focusing on user-friendly exploration.

## Project Insights
â€¢ The **Blue card** dominates revenue generation, followed by Silver.  
â€¢ **Swipe transactions** account for the highest revenue compared to chip and online.  
â€¢ Customers with a **Graduate** education and **Businessman** roles drive the most revenue.  
â€¢ **High-income groups** contribute significantly more than others.  
â€¢ Revenue is largely concentrated in **TX, NY, CA, FL, and NJ**.  
â€¢ Quarter-wise trends show consistent growth with peaks in **Q1 and Q3**.

## Final Conclusion
The credit card dashboard reveals that focusing on swipe-based, blue-category customers from top-performing states and professions can increase ROI. Targeted campaigns for graduate, high-income, and businessman segments, combined with enhanced chip/online transaction adoption, can unlock further growth.
